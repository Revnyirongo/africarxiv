Enabling Research & Education Collaboration

Background

● Connectivity: Vital for Research and Education

○ Enables access, collaboration, innovation, and 

equal opportunities

● Underserved communities 

○ 144 Health Centers (RHSP)

○ Research to tackle HIV prevalence

○ Connectivity required for patient care, and 

collaboration

○ Tackling SDGs 3 & 4

Connectivity Gap

● Optical fiber coverage 

(national) – Backhaul

● Map showing OFC 

coverage by key 

infrastructure players

4



Enabling Research & Education Collaboration

Connectivity Gap

● 4G Population Coverage – estimated at 80%

● Satellite Connectivity - High-Latency (200ms +)  

- Low Earth Orbit?

● 20% of the population including R&E requires innovative 

solutions for fairly low-latency connectivity!

How does this gap reflect in the communities?

● Gap in research in health, agriculture, and education leads to a decline in well-being and livelihood.

6



Enabling Research & Education Collaboration

Objectives

● Fairly low latency (up to 50ms to RENU 

backbone)

● Bandwidth – Sufficient for the use cases

● Costs (Installation & Maintenance) –

Affordable to the communities

Enabling Research & Education Collaboration

Microwave Point-to-Point links?

● Line-of-sight (LoS)

● Deployed in rural areas with gentle terrain

● What about areas with rugged terrain with no line-of-sight to 

the nearest towers?

8



Enabling Research & Education Collaboration

Implementation

● Leveraging the 80% 4G coverage

● Enhancing LTE signal reception

● Antenna gain of more than 30 dBi

● Parabolic reflector antenna used to enhance gain

● LTE device compatible with Satellite TV offset dish

9



Enabling Research & Education Collaboration

Implementation

● Satellite TV Offset Dish

○ Reflector antenna – Directional (Oriented to face tower)

○ Concentrates incoming signal on LTE ODU

○ Focuses outgoing signal to serving tower in a beam

Challenges Overcome

18

● Frequent downtime as a result of LTE session hanging

○ Required physical LTE ODU restart

○ Overcome by running a script to check the LTE interface and restart in the event 

of a session hang

What the researchers say

19

“ Remote health centers now have seamless Internet-based 

communication with the Ministry of Health, Regional Referral 

Centers, District Health Offices, and regional health authorities. 

This has enhanced remote implementation, training, mentoring, 

and monitoring of health systems and services.
