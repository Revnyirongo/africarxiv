How Does KENET support the Community

Promoting Inclusive Access

● KENET's commitment extends beyond providing advanced tools and 

infrastructure. It's about leveling the playing field for educational 

institutions across Kenya. 

● KENET's solutions are designed to be both affordable and sustainable, 

ensuring that institutions of all sizes and resource levels can effectively 

utilize digital technologies in education. 

● This accessibility is key to bridging the digital divide and promoting 

inclusive access to quality education.



Transforming education through ICTTransforming learning, research and working environments using ICT

Digital Learning Platforms

● KENET has undertaken strategic investments in digital learning 

platforms to meet the ever-evolving needs of its member institutions. 

Among the standout initiatives are:

● The hosting and customization of Moodle Learning Management 

Systems (LMS) at KENET's state-of-the-art Tier-3 data centers. 

● The KENET Web Conference Platform

● The KENET Statistical Portal

● Automated backup solutions, ensuring the uninterrupted availability of 

the Moodle systems.

Moodle LMS

● The implementation of Moodle begins with a secure, high-

performance infrastructure that ensures reliability and scalability. 

● Customization is the key to tailoring Moodle to meet the unique 

requirements of each member institution.

The KENET Web Conference Platform 

● Once Moodle LMS is expertly set up and customized to meet the 

unique needs of member institutions, it is seamlessly integrated with 

the KENET Web conference platform running on the BigBlueButton 

(BBB)

Integration of  Moodle and BBB

● KENET shares a secret code that makes the institutions create virtual 

classes in Moodle LMS.

Real-Time Statistics and Analytics

Moodle Analytics and Beyond: The KENET Statistics Portal

● In our commitment to data-driven education, KENET has gone 

beyond standard Moodle analytics and reporting. 



Transforming education through ICTTransforming learning, research and working environments using ICT

Real-Time Statistics and Analytics

The KENET Statistics Portal

● We have developed a centralized 

statistics portal, a valuable resource for 

faculty and administrators within our 

member institutions that empowers them 

with real-time insights into the 

performance and engagement of web 

conference classes, complementing the 

data provided by Moodle analytics.



Transforming education through ICTTransforming learning, research and working environments using ICT

Real-Time Statistics and Analytics

● This additional layer of analytics specifically focuses on the live and 

interactive aspects of education, which is vital in the current 

landscape of remote and blended learning.

• Bridging the Digital Divide: By 

offering these technologies to 

institutions regardless of their size or 

resources, we promote inclusive access 

to quality education. 

• The synergy of these tools levels the 

educational playing field, making high-

quality education available to all.

The Impact

Achieving Continuity

Increased Confidence

.

Enhanced Proficiency 

.

Technical Support and 

Troubleshooting 

.

Training and Support

Continuous support 

ensures that our 

members have access 

to assistance when they 

encounter technical 

issues. 

Training equips faculty 

and administrators with 

the skills and 

knowledge needed to 

proficiently use the 

digital learning tools.

Through training, 

educators gain confidence 

in using these tools to their 

full potential. This 

confidence can result in 

more innovative teaching.

Challenges Encountered and Mitigations

• While the integration of Moodle, BigBlueButton (BBB), and the 

statistics portal offers numerous benefits, here are some of the challenges 

we have encountered and the mitigations:

What next? The future of  Digital Learning Platforms

• AI-Powered Chatbots and Virtual Assistants: Chatbots and virtual 

assistants will provide instant help to learners, answering questions, 

offering guidance, and personalizing learning pathways.



Transforming education through ICTTransforming learning, research and working environments using ICT

What next? The future of  Digital Learning Platforms

• Immersive Learning Experiences: Virtual reality (VR) and 

augmented reality (AR) will be integrated into digital learning 

platforms, offering immersive and interactive experiences that enhance 

interactive learning.

• Regulation and Quality Assurance: Governments and educational 

bodies will develop policies and regulations to ensure quality, 

accessibility, and ethical considerations in online education.
