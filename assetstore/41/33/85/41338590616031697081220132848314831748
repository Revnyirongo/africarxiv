Introduction

• Multifaceted and interrelated scientific, 
technological and socio-economic issues that 
require coherent government support across 
disciplinary, sectoral and policy silos (OECD, 
2019). 

• Tackling global challenges of unprecedented 
scale and scope requires better strategic 
orientation and holistic co-ordination of 
Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) 
interventions. 

• More recently, the COVID-19 pandemic has 
reinforced the urgency for better frameworks 
of collective action towards common and 
well-defined objectives (OECD, 2020b). 



An STI 
policy 
perspective

Limitations of traditional STI policies, such as weak directionality, lack 
of holistic co-ordination and fragmentation of the policy mix led to 
various types of systemic interventions, commonly labelled as 
‘Mission-oriented innovation policies’ (MOIPs).

MOIPs are defined as a co-ordinated package of policy and regulatory 
measures tailored specifically to mobilise science, technology and 
innovation in order to address well-defined objectives related to a 
societal challenge, in a defined timeframe. 

These measures span different stages of the innovation cycle from 
research to demonstration and market deployment, mix supply-push 
and demand-pull instruments, and cut across various policy fields, 
sectors and disciplines. 

Marks a major shift from the traditional narrow R&D to embrace 
social transformation in various fields and tackle “grand challenges”. 



Characteristics of MOIP

FOLLOW AN OPEN AND 
NON-PRESCRIPTIVE 

APPROACH, IDENTIFYING 
PROBLEMS, NOT 

SOLUTIONS’, BUT BROAD 
PRIORITY AREAS OF 

FOCUS.

SET OBJECTIVES THAT 
HAVE THE EXPECTED 

MISSION 
CHARACTERISTICS: CLEAR, 

BOLD AND 
INSPIRATIONAL, WITH 

WIDE SOCIETAL 
RELEVANCE, AMBITIOUS 

BUT REALISTIC, 
TARGETED, MEASURABLE, 

TIME-BOUND AND 
SOLUTION NEUTRAL. 

SETTING MISSIONS IS A 
GRADUAL AND INCLUSIVE 

PROCESS, THROUGH 
WHICH THE SCOPE OF 

OBJECTIVES IS 
PROGRESSIVELY 

NARROWED DOWN FROM 
BROAD CHALLENGES AND 
MISSIONS TO OBJECTIVES 

SET IN PROJECTS. 

INITIATIVES MIX SOCIETAL 
AND ECONOMIC 

OBJECTIVES. THIS CAN 
GENERATE SOME 

MISMATCH IN TERMS OF 
THE GEOGRAPHIC SCOPE 

OF THE POLICY 
INTERVENTION NEEDED 

TO FULFIL THESE 
DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES. 

MULTI-LEVEL

‘NESTED’, MULTI-POLAR 

AND CROSS-MINISTERIAL / 
CROSS-AGENCY 
GOVERNANCE

EXPLORATION OF THE

GIVEN CHALLENGE. 



Grand Challenges
Refers to long-term and complex problems that are not always solvable though market processes, as they have also social and 
organizational dimensions. 

They typically require combinations of different technologies and require some degree as well of behavioral changes, depending on 
the nature of the problem to be addressed. Examples of grand challenges include climate change, pandemics, and sustainable mobility 
systems.

Overall, when policymakers consider STI policy goals to address grand challenges, it requires thinking about the governance of STI 
policy in a new and more ‘actionable’ manner, due to the complexity and high-level ambition of these objectives.

Traditionally, the main goals of STI policy have been twofold, namely, to enhance the frontiers of human knowledge and to improve 
the technological competitiveness of industry in the economy. 

Not an alternative, replacing the two traditional goals. Instead, it can be seen as an additional goal. Therefore, today, the two
traditional goals (knowledge frontier and technological competitiveness) continue rightly so to be at the core to STI policy rationale.

The new approach of STI policy is to induce large, durable, and systemic change.

The impact-oriented nature of grand-challenges STI policy instruments requires not only funding or R&D support but also measures
addressing regulatory, organizational, behavioral, and issues that might hinder rapid uptake and real-world impact of new knowledge.



Kenya’s STI policy and regulatory framework

The STI system is built on a 
foundation dating over 100 

years.

Earliest laboratory 
(Agricultural Scott) was 

established in 1903.

Science and Technology Act 
enacted in 1977 paving way 

for  creation of National 
Council for Science and 

Technology.

Major reforms in STI policy, 
regulatory framework 

informed by Vision 2030 
(launched in 2008) and 

2010 Constitution.

2013 STI Act created 
NACOSTI, NRF and KeNIA.

2020 STI policy is awaiting 
Cabinet approval, though in 

use.



Three purposes of STI Act

• to facilitate the promotion, co-ordination 
and regulation of the progress of science, 
technology and innovation in the 
country;

• to assign priority to the development of 
science, technology and innovation; 

• to entrench science, technology and 
innovation into the national production 
system and for connected purposes



Broad Vision for STI 

• Embedded in Kenya’s Vision 2030 whose overall goal is: “Transform Kenya into a newly 
industrializing, middle-income country providing high quality of life to all its citizens by 
the year 2030 in a clean and secure environment”. 

• The Vision is anchored on three pillars (Economic, Social and Political) together with a set 
of foundations or enablers that include STI.

• Kenya’s global and regional obligations e.g. SDGs, Africa Agenda 2063 call for increased 
investment in science and technology, with an objective of generating innovations (goods 
and services) that can overcome economic and environmental challenges.

• Chapter 2 article 11 section (2) and section (3) of the Constitution state that: The State 
shall recognize the role of science and indigenous technologies in the development of 
the nation; Chapter (4) article (40) section (5) on intellectual property rights states that: 
the State shall support, promote and protect the intellectual property rights of the 
people of Kenya.

Kenya innovation survey 2015

Minimal cooperation between firms in the development of product and process 
innovations. 

Innovation development was undertaken independently or through the adoption 
or modification of other companies’ products. 

A negligible 2.7 percent of the survey firms cooperated with universities or 
research institutions in implementing product innovations. 

The low-level of cooperation resulted in low absorption of new technologies by 
these firms. 



Opportunities

Cross-sectoral collaboration allows for broad, all-encompassing perspective with increased information sharing. 

Utilization of private R&D investment and collaboration with the private sector.

Academics and policymakers can engage in processes of co-creation on MOIP/grand challenges oriented STI 
policies.

system-thinking, embedding STI innovation policy instruments in suitable mixes for the uptake and scaling up of 
new technologies.

Granularity remains rather coarse, consulting with stakeholders to achieve a sharper focus.

Involvement of experts and practitioners from various sectors, as well as relevant ministries and agencies 
within the government. 



Conclusion

• Science, Technology and Innovation is one of the enabling sectors for 
national transformation.

• The socioeconomic performance of any country is closely tied to the 
application of science and technology. 

• There is need for policy instruments and policy mixes that are fit for the 
purpose, designed with an impact orientation and a systemic approach. 

• Notable strides in STI policy development to move from traditional narrow 
focus towards broader MOIP.

• Uneven and slow policy implementation marked by weak ppublic-sector 
organizations.

• Opportunities for transformation exist but rapid steps to support the sector, 
foster inclusive coordinated approaches are needed.
