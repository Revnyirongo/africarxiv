Persistent Identifiers



Understanding Identifiers

★ A long lasting reference to a digital resource (ORCID)
★ A unique long-lasting reference to digital objects of various types, and are a 

core element of open research. (Westminster)
★ PIDs are labels that locate, identify and share information about digital objects
★ A PID may be connected to a set of metadata describing an object rather than to 

the object itself. 
★ Allow different platforms to exchange information consistently and 

unambiguously and thus provide a reliable way to track citations and reuse.



PIDs
What is a persistent identifier (PID)?

https://research-
data.urosario.edu.co/dataset.xhtml?
persistentId=doi:10.34848/GJO6SY

https://doi.org/10.34848/GJO6SY

Unique alphanumeric string referring to a 
digital resource.

Always points to the same resource 
(a metadata representation)

PIDs for people, places and things

PIDs for people (researchers) 
include ISNI and ORCID

https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6622-4910

PID for places (research 
institutions) include ROR

https://ror.org/01y2jtd41

PIDs for things (research out outs and 
resources) include DOIs, handles, IGSN, 

ARK and more

Reusable
(Meta)data  are richly described with a plurality of accurate & relevant attributes

Interoperable
(Meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for 
knowledge representation.

Accessible
(Meta)data are retrievable via an identifier using a standardized protocol
Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

Findable
(Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier

Making research data FAIR
With PIDs



Why are PIDs important?

PIDs like DOIs, ORCID iDs y ROR IDs increase the
discoverability, access, citation, reutilization, and 

recognition of research outputs and resources

Beyond Internet Connection



Why we exist

We are a global community that share a common interest: to ensure that research 
outputs and resources are openly available and connected so that their reuse can 
advance knowledge across and between disciplines, now and in the future.

DataCite



More than DOI

Create DOIs. Creation of persistent identifier 
(PID) metadata records. Make research outputs 
and resources discoverable and citable for the 
long term

Integrate workflows. Enhance research 
workflows and services through integration

Enable discovery. Enable discovery of research 
outputs and resources and reporting with 
advanced tools and analytics.

Promote reuse. Promote reuse with flexible, 
state-of-the art tools and technology

Partnering

Our approach has always been to partner with communities (such as UbuntuNet 
Alliance, IGSN, RDA) to learn more about their needs, develop capacity and partner 
with a common vision.

Global Access Program

DataCite has launched a global access program with support 
from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative to promote greater equity 
in the global research ecosystem. 

By expanding access to research outputs and resources in 
under-resourced regions, the program aims to support the 
participation of researchers in the global scholarly community 
and enable greater collaboration and innovation across 
borders.



Global Access Program

● The program is focused on building relationships with 
organizations and individuals who are working to support 
research and innovation in emerging and underrepresented 
communities.

● By working together with these communities, DataCite hopes 
to learn more about their unique needs and perspectives, and 
to develop new tools and resources that can help to meet 
those needs.

● The program is also focused on building capacity within these 
communities, by providing training and resources that can 
help organizations to better manage and share their research 
outputs and resources.

Building Capacity



Global Access Program

Funding. The program will provide the opportunity for communities to 
seek funding to support activities related to the program.

Technical infrastructure. Through partnerships with local and 
international stakeholders, the program will seek to support communities 
in building technical infrastructure per their needs (and design).

Capacity building. In learning from local community stakeholders, we 
seek to build better capacity to support emerging regions.

Three components



The Global Access Fund

● It aims to enable organizations worldwide to 
make their research outputs discoverable. 

● Non profit orgs in Africa, Asia, Middle East and 
Latin America can apply.

● Funding categories:
○ Outreach activities: up to €10,000
○ Infrastructure development: up to €20,000
○ Demonstrators: up to €50,000

● Applications open Sep 1 - Oct 15
● 160 Applications from all GAP regions
● Projects will run throughout 2024
● Working towards 2024 GAF
