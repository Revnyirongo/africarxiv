ORCID provides three main services

3

The ORCID APIs

A set of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), as well as the services and 

support of communities of practice enabling interoperability between an ORCID 

record and member organizations 

An ORCID record

A digital CV/profile connected to the ORCID iD, that can include employment, 

education, funding, peer review, research output and other metadata

The ORCID iD

A unique, persistent identifier free of charge to researchers



The ability to disambiguate researchers is critical 
for a trustworthy scholarly record

What is an ORCID consortium?

An ORCID consortium is a group of three/five or more not-for-profit organizations

that band together to form a community of practice that can apply ORCID

services and resources in national or regional contexts, using global

implementation standards.



Consortium / Strategy through a community of practice

Domain

ORCID’s mission - enable interoperability between research information systems, connect researchers to 

their contributions.

Community

The broader national/regional research community, including, among others, research institutions, 

universities, funders, and, of course, researchers, who should always be in the center of what we do. 

Practice

Cross-community interaction that strengthens both the technology and communication of research 

information-sharing



Consortium / Benefits

Visibility and monitoring

Visibility of national research contributions through authoritative, trusted ORCID data

Influence and participation

Coordinate groups to influence adoption by service providers and platform and participate in the 

ORCID-governance

Favorable fee model

Premium membership and additional services (Affiliation Manager among others) available at a 

reduced price



Consortium / How a consortium lead works with the 
members?

about 
integrations and 
discussion about 

next steps

The Regional Consortium approach facilitates adoption

Not all countries have the resources to take 

advantage of our current national 

consortium program.

Some countries have insufficient capacity or 

too few organizations to support a national 

consortium.

Establish a Regional Consortium approach to 

facilitate adoption.

Institutions from several countries can band 

together, which reduces gaps in global 

adoption.

The problems The solution

13https://info.orcid.org/orcid-for-consortia/regional-conditions/

https://info.orcid.org/orcid-for-consortia/regional-conditions/


The Regional Consortium approach

● The consortium lead may be based in any country, members need to 

include organizations from countries that include Low-, Lower-

Middle, and Upper-Middle income countries.

● A maximum of 85% of the consortium members may be based in a 

single country.

● It needs to include organizations from a minimum of three countries 

from within the defined region. 

● It should consist of at least five members during the initial formation 

year, and no less than 10 members from the second year onwards.

● Organizations may always choose the consortium option that aligns 

best with their strategy (including the option of forming their own 

national one).

Participation Program 
(GPP)?

ORCID adoption is currently higher in countries with 
higher income levels

● Based on an analysis of ORCID adoption 

by established authors in 59 countries*, 

using Dimensions, Crossref and ORCID 

data

● While indicative, this data points to the 

disadvantages that researchers in the 

Global South face in getting equitable 

visibility and recognition for their work

ORCID’s Global Participation Program (GPP) is a two-pronged 
approach to achieving this goal

Global Participation 
Program (GPP)

Membership Equity 
Program

Global 
Participation Fund



More about the MEP and the GPF

Membership Equity Program (MEP)

● Discounted membership fee structure for 

consortium members:

○ 80% discount for low-income 

countries*

○ 50% discount for lower-middle 

income countries*

● Lower threshold of 3 members for the 

initial year

● Fully funded by ORCID

Global Participation Fund (GPF)

● Two grant programs: 

○ Community Development and 

Outreach to fund local partners to build 

ORCID communities of practice in the 

Global South

○ Technical integration to fund 

development of systems that are likely to 

drive participation in the Global South

● Made possible by the generosity of ORCID’s 

founding lenders (admin costs funded by 

ORCID)

20* As defined by World Bank income classifications



The structure of the program supports a diversity of 
grantees to spread the risk and increase the chance 
of positive outcomes 

21

Other Grantee Benefits

● Dedicated ORCID staff contact

● Invitation to participate in the ORCID 

grantee forum and community

● Invitations to Grantee community events

● Invitations to ORCID virtual and in-

person events

● Inclusion in ORCID’s ongoing 

communications program

2 Grant cycles per year

~5 Grants per cycle

$5–20k Funding award per grant



The focus and goals of the Fund align with ORCID’s 
strategic objective to increase global participation

Focus Communities
Organizations engaged in research and scholarship in low- and lower-middle-income countries, 

particularly in the Global South, where ORCID participation to date has been low.

Goals
Remedy ORCID participation gaps in the focus communities area by providing grants to:

● Develop ORCID Communities of Practice in low- and lower-middle-income countries

● Build understanding and use of ORCID in local contexts

● Create and enhance technical integrations to support these burgeoning communities
