Introduction Contd

• Universities have the responsibility to equip learners 

with visual impairment with inclusive library services 

and  technology required to support their information, 

learning and research needs 

• Yet discussion on how to promote diversity and 

inclusion in order to meet the academic and 

information needs of these category of students 

tends to focus mainly on the general population and 

not on those with special needs, such as visual 

impairment.

• Recently, few university libraries in Nigeria are 

striving to offer inclusive services for ease of access 

to physical and virtual spaces, and learning 

resources with the aim of promoting diversity, equity 

and inclusion.

(gender, race, ability, religion,

of analytical and critical

a crucial role in empowering 
diverse populations for full 
participation in a democratic 
society” (ALA, 2015)

students with VI access to 
the basic assistive 
technology software.
