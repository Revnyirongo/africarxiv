OVERVIEW

• Global Surgical Gap: 5 billion people around the world are deprived of even the 
most fundamental surgical care. This represents one of the most significant 
disparities in global health.

• Kyabirwa Surgical Center: Established in 2019 by Mount Sinai's Surgery 
Department.

• Mission: Design a sustainable, replicable surgical system.

• Innovation: Pioneering a novel approach to disseminate surgical expertise.

• Objective: Boost affordable, safe surgical care in isolated world regions

• Collaborative Surgery: Leveraging high-speed tech, surgeons from Uganda and 
Mt. Sinai (NY) work together in real-time on surgical tasks.

GLOBAL SURGERY:  EVOLVING A SHARED SURGERY KNOWLEDGE 
STRATEGY

Surgeons advance 
knowledge with 
books and an atlas 
as a guide.

Surgeons advance 
knowledge by 
reviewing up to 
date publications.

Surgeons advance 
knowledge by training 
at specialty centers and 
at “hands on” teaching 
courses.

Surgeons advance 
knowledge with 
the aid of a visiting 
expert; surgical 
missions.

Surgeon advancing 
knowledge working with 
others from around the 
world, remotely with 
augmented reality and 
robotic assistance.
