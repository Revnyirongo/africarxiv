Introduction

• E-learning is the form of learning
that involves the use of digital
platforms in education, training
or knowledge sharing (Martinez-
Garcia et al., 2023).

• It is beneficial because of the
advantages it brings that include
easy access, availability,
scalability, effective use of
resources, simplification of
personal learning and many more
(Weerarathna et al., 2023).

Introduction

• The 2022 Ubuntunet
presentation titled “Tanzanian
digital technologies in teaching,
learning and research process:
Availability and Coverage”
showed that there is a need of
developing more African based
E-learning platforms that can be
tailored to cover our needs.

Based on the feedback a study
was conducted in 6 regions of
Tanzania to assess the readiness
of using digital platforms for
accessing agriculture knowledge.

Why 
Agriculture?

Need for agriculture knowledge:
• Lack of easy access to agriculture 

knowledge

• Lack of easy access to extension 
services.

• Negative perception and myth 
around agriculture.

• Low productivity 

• Food loss

According to Agenda 10/30 (URT, 
2022;Ndimbwa etal, 2019)
