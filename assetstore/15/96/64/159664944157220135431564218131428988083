INTRODUCTION

❖Like many countries, higher education institutions in Sierra Leone were 
closed during COVID-19 pandemic

❖In post covid era, all universities are required to upscale teaching mode 
towards Open Distance Learning and Online course delivery

❖Faculties are expected to partially teach using digital learning tools and 
keep supervising research activities online

❖Information and Communication Technology recognised as a strategic 
priority for universities

❖Open Science is an integral part of the National Science, Technology and 
Innovation Strategy

STATE OF SCHOLARLY PUBLISHING

• Research and knowledge systems – like most post independent Africa countries, 

the higher education landscape is controlled, funded and supervised by the 

government through the Ministry of Education. 

• Research Publication and Communication – Scientific research and publications 

are serious challenges. It is almost impossible to quantify research outputs. Limited 

functional in-campus journals and low evidence of subscription to journals. We are 

grateful to Research4Life for providing online resources -  e-books, e-journals, etc.

• Poor Infrastructure –University campuses operate on low or unreliable internet 

bandwidth. CT facilities are inadequate

• Mentorship – Limited mentoring and network building for early career researchers

• Gender and Research – Equitable participation and full realisation of women’s 

potentials very low

The following core national policies and strategies established 

and fully operational:

▪ National ICT Policy

▪ National Innovation and Digital Strategy

▪ National Open Distance Learning policy

▪ National Science, Technology and Innovation Council (NSTIC) to 

promote research, development and innovation

LESSONS LEARNT

▪ Stakeholder sensitisation and outreach on Open Science

▪ Develop Open Science policies at national and institutional levels

▪ Shared open science infrastructures will support the long-term 

sustainability

▪ Capacity building for Open Science actors -  ICT, Librarians and 

academics

▪ Promoting innovative approaches for Open Science - Open Access, Open 

Data, Public Engagement and Citizen Science

▪ Tackling the role of publishers, including ownership of published 

materials and Challenges of Intellectual Property Right (IRP)

▪ Monitoring the transition to Open Science and its implications
