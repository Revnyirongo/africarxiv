ABOUT THE EIFL/SPIDER 
PROJECT

•Born out of the need to advocate for the access to online research by 
East African Researchers to the world after a 2010 OA Workshop in 
Kenya supported by the Open Society Foundations (OSF)
•Hence increasing the availability and visibility in the Region through the 
OA Journals and OA Repositories
•In 2013, EIFL – Electronic Information for Libraries received funding 
from SPIDER (the Swedish Programme for ICT in Developing Regions 
DSV, Department of Computer and System Sciences, Stockholm 
University) to cascade OA initiatives in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda
•Still through EIFL, SPIDER extended the funding to 2016 which was 
further extended to SPIDER II from 2018-2019

•Improved OA repositories in Uganda that help better discover and use 
the digital content. 
•The Project included 11 institutions both Public and Private
