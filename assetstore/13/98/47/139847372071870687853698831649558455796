Presentation Outline

❖      Introduction and Background of the Study

❖      Problem Statement

❖      Objectives

❖      Methodology

❖      Findings

❖      Conclusion



Introductions and Background of the Study

Gender equity is not 
only a fundamental 
right. It is a keystone 
of a prosperous and 
modern economy that 
provides inclusive and 
sustainable growth.

 



Introductions and Background of the Study

❖      

❖      

❖      

According to UNICEF (2020) , world over the gender divide 
is  growing as technologies become more sophisticated

Realizing that gender equality  is essential for ensuring 
that men and women  can fully participate in the 
betterment of the economy and societies at large, the 
G20 leaders first committed to “ women full economic 
and  social participation .(  G20 report 2012)

They then set an ambitious goal of target (25 x 25) to 
reduce the gender inequality gap in labour market 
participation



Introductions and Background of the Study

❖      
The encompassing of digital innovation and technology in 
the lives of women,  provides new avenues for economic  
empowerment  and can contribute to gender equality 

❖      
Digital innovation and technology offers a leapfrog 
opportunity for all and can be used as a tool to bridge the 
gender divide in many ways.  

❖      
By infusing digital innovation and technology in the day to 
day lives of  women it can fosters greater gender equality 
and build a more inclusive digital world. 



Introductions and Background of the Study

❖      

The roadmap in achieving equity in digital innovation and 
technology is an uphill because there is no clear indication 
to what extent women  living with disabilities are included 
in these efforts.

❖      
This therefore in turn widen the gender divide in digital 
innovation and technology putting women living with 
disabilities at a disadvantage.

❖      
In promoting the gender equality for women living with 
disabilities in all spheres of life, Zambia has strengthened 
the policy and legal framework. 



Introductions and Background of the Study

The Zambian National 
Gender Policy was 
revised in 2019 to 

ensure the attainment 
of gender equality in 

the development 
process  redressing the 

existing gender 
imbalances.



Introductions and Background of the Study

The country has 
observed a positive 
trend in  the gender 
inequality which has 

continued to fall from 
%62.7 in 2011 to  
%58.7 in 2015 to 

%52.2 in 2019 and 
%51 in 2022. 



Introductions and Background of the Study

However, the 
percentage 

representation of 
women living with 
disabilities is not 

known in the 
information provided 

causing a definite 
inequality in digital 

innovation and 
technology as well.  



Introductions and Background of the Study

It is against this 
background that this 

paper sought to 
Investigate the 

Efficacy of Digital 
Innovation and 

technology in the lives 
of women living with 
disabilities in Zambia 

and Zimbabwe, 
Southern Africa.

However, there is  
Gender  Divide in  
access to Digital 
Innovation and 

Technology  which 
disadvantages women 
living with disabilities 
as they are a minority 
group as compared to 
the so called normal 

Zimbabwe has a strong 

Gender Policy (2013-

2017) that places  

strong emphasis on 

gender equality and 

equity and evasions  of 

a just gender society in 

which men and women 

enjoy  equity and 

benefit as equal 

partners in the 

development of the 

country   



Problem Statement

Studies globally have shown that efforts are made in a bid to bridge the gender divide in 

digital innovation and technology as recorded in the report “ digital labour platforms and the 

future of work (ILO 2018). Zambia and Zimbabwe’s national gender policies of 2019 and 

2017 respectively are a way of responding to the gap of gender inequality in all spheres of 

life. Even when global and regional efforts of curbing the gender divide in digital Innovation 

and technology are evident, there is no traceable  record  to what extent women living with 

disabilities are included hence the knowledge gap this study sought to fill.



Objectives

1. To establish constraints that women living with disabilities face in accessing digital innovation 
and technology services.

2. To explore the opportunities that women living with disabilities would gain when equity and 
equality is implored on them in accessing digital innovation and technology services.

3. To provide recommendations on improving the  accessibility of the digital innovation and 
technology services to women living with disabilities

4 Physically Impaired, 4 
Visually Impaired and 4 

Hearing Impaired

DATA ANALYSIS

Thematically- open-axial-
selective coding

NON PROBABILITY-
Purposive



Presentation of Findings

The findings reviewed that women living with 
disabilities have a lot of constraints in digital innovation 

and technology among others are:

0ut dated or non availability of assistive technologies 
to make the environment more accessible.

Services , Systems and policies that are nonexistent limiting 
the full participation of women living with disabilities in many 

areas because of how they are framed.

Attitudinal barriers the women living with disabilities face 
stands in the way of them accessing digital innovations and 

technology services.



Presentation of Findings

As regards to the opportunities for women living with disabilities stands to gain when 
gender equity and equality is implored on them in digital innovation and technology 

services, the study reviewed that:

Potential to 
increase the 

independency, 
safety and control 

over their 
environment

Increase their 
self confidence, 
introduce them  

to a world of 
privacy

Increase their 
self confidence, 
introduce them  

to a world of 
privacy



Presentation of Findings

The study recommended the 
following to be implored  in the 

quest  to improve the accessibility 
of  digital innovations and 

technology services to women living 
with disabilities

Investing in 
interactive systems 

which use torch 
screens in all works 

of life

The Introduction of 
robots to aid those that 
are Physically Impaired

Governments to partner with other 
stakeholders so that the department of 
ICT in the ministries is well enhanced 

with recent technology which will 
encompass  easy access of the digital 

services to women living with disabilities 
too. 



Conclusion

❖      
Gender equality is not an isolated goal: it is critical to securing a 
sustainable future for the planet, addressing the root causes of poverty 
and upholding human rights, to leave no-one behind. 

❖      
Our call to adopt a feminist approach to the Global 
Digital Compact is much more than considering 
women living with disabilities in all their diversity.

❖      
It is the most effective path to securing a 
sustainable digitalization and building a digital 
society which works for everyone.
