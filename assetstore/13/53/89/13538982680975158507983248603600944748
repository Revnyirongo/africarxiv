Research Nexus 



What is metadata?
“Metadata is communication.

It describes and identifies an item, it defines relationships, it sets 
parameters for the range of actions something can engage in. 

As the things we read, write, create, use, move around, and engage 
with become more digital, metadata becomes more important, 
because without metadata, all that movement, interaction, and 
discovery, could not happen.”

- Juliane Schneider, Metadata 20/20 blog, 2017

https://metadata2020.org/blog/2017-09-14-metadata-and-communication/


Basic: titles; dates; author names; abstracts; DOI; location URL

Full-text URLs: e.g. for text-mining and Similarity Check

Crossmark: updates, retractions, corrections

Relationships: versions; translations; data; references; citation

Provenance: publisher/funder/steward information

Subject-specific: e.g. clinical trial info

Funding information: Funder Registry ID; award numbers/Grant DOIs

Contributor & Affiliations: ORCID iDs and ROR IDs preferred

What kind of <metadata>?





Reproducibility

Metadata as relationships 
between literature, data, 
software, protocols and more

Research integrity

Metadata as signals of 
trustworthiness including 
provenance information

Discoverability

More metadata means more 
systems have more pathways 
to find your work

Assessment 

Metadata can be used to analyze 
the outcomes of research and 
demonstrate compliance

Why metadata?
