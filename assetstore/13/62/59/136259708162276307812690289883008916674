BACKGROUND

The Lens and Cambia
● Cambia, founded in 1991, started Patent Lens in 

2001, the precursor of lens.org, the worldʼs first 
free and open full text patent search capability.

● In 2006, launched the worldʼs first public 
patent-disclosed sequence search capability for 
United States patent applications, which by 
2013, Lens.org had become the worldʼs leading 
open resource for patent sequences.

● In 2011, with seed money from USPTO, Cambia 
began extracting and resolving non-patent 
literature strings in collaboration with NIH-NCBI 
and Crossref, ultimately creating PatCite and 
In4M metric 

●

● In 2017 Cambia expanded its focus, in substantial 
collaboration with Microsoft Academic, NCBI PubMed 
and CrossRef to host and serve global academic 
research holdings and metadata.

● The Lens is now the worldʼs leading integrated 
innovation knowledge platform, using open and 
FAIRE data to merge patents, scholarly, legal and 
other key data in a single award-winning User 
Experience

● The Lens ensures privacy and confidentiality and its 
data is fully open, shareable and reusable, is free to 
every human on earth and has been up 24/7 for over 
22 years.

THE LENS

Meta Record Strategy
Lens use a “Meta Record” concept as a core element 
of our facility. We use a 15 digit open and persistent 
identifier, LensID, to expose credible variants, 
sources and context of knowledge artifacts, such as  
scholarly works or patents, while maintaining 
provenance,  and allowing aggregation, 
normalization, and quality-control of diverse 
metadata.

PATENTS

Explore, Search, 
Discover and Analyse
Our patent search capabilities offer advanced 
boolean functions, structured search, biological 
search, classification search, filtering and sorting 
options to find the most relevant and important 
patents.

Use advanced search options to find the most 
relevant and important patents; understand their 
families and timelines; explore the richness of 
classifications.  Explore the linkages with 
non-patent literature. Use facets and analytics to 
obtain new insights.

Lens Profiles
Unique to open data, Lens Profiles are 
auto-generated author and inventor profiles 
compatible with public ORCID records.

Compiled from publicly available data sources using 
the ORCID iD as the linking identifier.

Lens Profiles can be used to update or populate your 
ORCID record with scholarly works or patents from 
the Lens in just a few simple steps.

Freedom to innovate needs freedom to operate

DNA, RNA and proteins in patents are crucial  to 
deliver new science as outcomes - products and 
practice changes - for health, agriculture and the 
environment.    

Lens hosts the worldʼs largest publicly available 
database and toolkit for biological patents, with data 
source transparency, with many sequences uniquely 
in this dataset.

Create and explore scholarly or patent 
collections to understand who does 
what, when and where to inform 
decision-making.  Annotate the data and 
collate it along with third party data to 
develop more comprehensive and 
dynamic reports (coming soon)

Use open dynamic collections to create, curate, 
annotate and share dynamic portfolios of scholarly 
works and patents.

Explore these collections to understand who does 
what, when and where, who influences whom. These 
open tools inform decision-making for work product 
management, for partnering, for investing/funding  or 
for research trajectories.

Mission-aligned Metrics 
Measure what matters
No more proprietary, closed and irrelevant metrics 
that create perverse incentives and  neither 
recognize nor value the impact we need from 
knowledge.

Using rich, open and FAIRE metadata, and 
comprehensive linked data sets, users can create 
customized metrics that align with the missions of 
their institutions.

In4M

International Industry & 
Innovation Influence 
Mapping
In4M uses rich patent citations to both scholarly 
work and patents and scholarly citations to map the 
influence of scholarship on academia, innovation 
and industry.   

In4M explores, exposes and ranks the degree to 
which  researchersʼ works, or those of groups or 
entire institutions influence outcomes for  society.

17



Use open persistent identifiers (Lens Ids, PMIDs or 
DOIs) to discover which scholarly articles have 
influenced what patents and who is using 
scholarly work to build products. 

Explore who is citing your scholarly work(s) and 
map the influence on industry by visualising and 
exploring the network of linkages.
