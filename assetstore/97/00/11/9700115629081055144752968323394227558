▪Apart from Zimbabwe open university which is ODL model , the
rest of the Universities conventional hence demand for
accommodation is high.
▪Most Universities including University of Zimbabwe the first
Major university have failed to accommodate the students on
campus hence the boarding house scenarios sprouting.
▪The universities can only accommodate 25-30% of their
students only.
▪Landlords have adopted this as a money spinning business
model.
▪Many homes within the vicinities of the universities have been
changed into boarding homes and home owners relocating and
dedicating this space for the model to operationalise.



Purpose of Study
The purpose of the study is to investigate

the establishment of virtual libraries within

boarding houses located in the vicinity of

HIT University with the aim of cultivating

research and facilitating the creation of a

research and learning commons.



OBJECTIVES
• Investigate the existing challenges faced by students living in

boarding houses with regard to studying, research, and access to

learning resources.

• Explore successful examples of research and learning commons in

university campuses and analyse their positive impact on student

learning outcomes.

• Identify the essential components required for the creation and

maintenance of effective research and learning commons in

boarding houses.

• Measure the impact of establishing such spaces on student

academic performance, research engagement, and overall student

satisfaction.

• To propose a framework which will be adopted by boarding houses

for virtual libraries



• Expected Outcomes:

• The proposed research aims to:

• Enhance student learning experiences and academic

performance through improved access to

educational resources.

• Foster a sense of community and collaboration

among students residing in boarding houses.

• Provide valuable insights for accommodation

providers to develop student-friendly and research-

oriented living spaces.



• HIT accommodate 502 students only out of the 2500 student population

• The balance are absorbed into the boarding houses. @ HIT 60 B -Houses

• Boarding houses, are residential properties located near university
campuses or in close proximity to educational institutions.

• The concept of boarding houses within university vicinities is to provide
students with a convenient and affordable housing option while they are
attending college or university.

• These houses typically offer individual rooms or shared bedrooms, along
with common areas such as kitchens, bathrooms, and living spaces that are
shared among the residents.

• Boarding houses can be privately owned or managed by housing
organizations or educational institutions themselves.

• They often cater to students who are seeking an alternative to on-campus
dormitories or who prefer a more independent living arrangement.



Benefits of boarding houses for students include

• Proximity to Campus: located within walking distance or a short commute
from the university for convenience of classes and campus facilities

• Affordability: often provide a more cost-effective housing option compared to
other alternatives such as rental apartments

• Community and Social Interaction: Living in a boarding house allows students
to interact and build studying relationships with their peers

• Facilities and Amenities: Boarding houses generally provide basic amenities
such as furnished rooms, Wi-Fi, laundry facilities, and communal spaces for
relaxation and studying (Green Library Concept) . Some boarding houses may
also offer additional services like cleaning, meal plans, or organized events.

• Independence and Responsibility: Boarding houses offer students a greater
sense of independence and autonomy compared to on-campus housing
options.

• They provide an environment where students can learn to manage their own
living arrangements, budgeting, and day-to-day responsibilities preparing them
towards bachelor & spinster life phases



Concept of Research & Learning Commons @ Universities

• Research Commons: A Research Commons is a physical or virtual space within a
university that is specifically designed to support research activities and
collaboration among students, faculty, and researchers.

• These learning spaces can include areas for group work, individual study spaces,

instructional rooms, computer pools, multi-media labs and soft seating areas

• Consultation Services: Librarians, research specialists, and subject matter experts
may be available to provide guidance on research methodologies, literature
reviews, data management, and other research-related inquiries.

• Workshops and Training: Research Commons often organize workshops, seminars,
and training sessions to enhance research skills, promote scholarly
communication, and provide guidance on research ethics and best practice.

• Learning Commons aim to provide an inclusive and supportive learning
environment for student. Academic Support Services They offer academic support
services such as tutoring, writing centers, subject-specific assistance, and
technology support to help students excel in their studies.



Methodology:

• Literature Review: Conduct an extensive review of academic literature, case studies, 

and reports related to research and learning commons in university settings, 

boarding houses, and student accommodation.

• Surveys and Questionnaires: Administer surveys and questionnaires to students 

residing in boarding houses and universities to gather data on their current study 

environments, preferences, and needs.

• Interviews: Conduct interviews with university officials, accommodation managers, 

and student representatives to gain insights into potential challenges and 

opportunities.

• Observations: Observe and analyze the study habits and interactions of students in 

existing research and learning commons facilities.



Challenges faced by students at boarding houses

▪Wifi : While Tel one, Net one, and Econet all offer limitless WIFI, some
boarding houses would rather juice after it's all said and done to maximize
on profits
▪Limited Study & Personal Spaces: Boarding houses might lack
dedicated study areas or quiet spaces where students can focus on their
academic work
▪Hard Copies: Depending on the location and proximity to the university,
students might need to rely solely on the university library, which may
involve additional travel time and logistics
▪Lack of Collaborative Spaces: Collaborative work is an integral part of
academic life, and boarding houses may not provide adequate spaces for
students to engage in group projects or collaborative research.
▪Time Management and Academic Support: Living in a boarding house
may increase the need for students to manage their time effectively, as
they navigate shared responsibilities.

to universities. The dean's office and the admissions office will be connected to the

software.

▪ Students are given access to information about boarding houses as soon as they

register and allocated according to programs and part

▪ access to biographical information so that, in the event of an emergency, they are awar

e of the students and their backgrounds.

▪ Provide training sessions or workshops to familiarize boarding house residents with the

virtual library's features, resources, and tools through student librarianship

▪ Negotiations with internet service providers e.g. Tel one to subsidise subscriptions for

registered boarding houses

▪ Negotiate with ENRENS like ZIMREN etc to provide services within 3-5 km radius

using edu roam.

▪ Investigate on mobile penetration & policy influence
