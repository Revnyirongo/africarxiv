LIBSENSE-RUFORUM Collaboration for
Improved Agricultural Research Data Management in Africa

Dr Pamela Abbott, Research Lead, LIBSENSE, Ms Nada Musa, Technical 
Specialist- Knowledge Management, RUFORUM



The Regional Universities Forum for Capacity Building 

in Agriculture (RUFORUM), established by ten Vice 

Chancellors in 2004, is a consortium of universities in 

Africa. December 2022 membership stands at 163 

universities in 40 countries.

OUR COVERAGE

Transforming agriculture in Africa requires innovative 

scientific research, education and outreach approaches. 

The education sector needs to be more connected to 

the new challenges facing rural communities and needs 

to build capacity of young people to be part of the 

transformation of the agricultural sector.

OUR MOTIVATION

INTRODUCING RUFORUM



OUR MISSION

To strengthen the capacities of universities to 

foster innovations responsive to demands of 

small-holder farmers through the training of high 

quality researchers and collaboration.

A vibrant, transformative universities catalyzing 

sustainable, inclusive agricultural development to 

feed and create prosperity for Africa.

OUR VISION

INTRODUCING RUFORUM



1. RUFORUM has aspired to harness the role of digital technologies in making research 

outputs and learning materials available for researchers, students and other 

stakeholders, as Africa still contributes just a little fraction of the world's research 

output. 

2. In light of this, RUFORUM and West and Central African Research and Education 

Network (WACREN) have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to enhance 

scientific and scholarly communication in Africa, through the AfricaConnect3 project 

and the LIBSENSE initiative. This cooperation is: 

✓ A step in the direction to help our native agriculture researchers to access 

valuable open resources to engage within their scientific discovery, and make 

decisions. 

✓ Expected to support and facilitate universities in acquiring relevant and practical 

data/information/knowledge for adoption of ICT in teaching and learning. 

✓ Networking universities to be able to train through innovative and creative ICT-

enabled techniques that deliver and enhance the student learning experience.

RUFORUM-LIBSENSE COLLABORATION 



Needs Assessment Aims and Objectives

1. To establish through a needs assessment questionnaire the key 
issues that should be addressed by a new state of the art agricultural 
data repository

2. To gather requirements for the data repository through targeting 
potential end users within the member institutions of RUFORUM who 
would be engaging with this repository

Main Preferred Uses of an Open Agricultural 
Data Repository 

To gain access to 
agricultural data 
once the projects 
that produced them 
are finished.

To store agricultural 
data safely and 
securely once the 
project I am 
collaborating on is 
finished.

research 
publications safely 
and securely once 
the project I am 
collaborating on is 
finished

requirements of 
publishers or 
funders who may 
want me to provide 
open access to data 
sets
