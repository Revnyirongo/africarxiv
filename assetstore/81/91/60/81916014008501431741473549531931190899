ABSTRACT 

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide a crucial framework for 

global progress and the advancement of human well-being. In Africa, the AfricaConnect 3 

team, consisting of GEANT, UbuntuNet Alliance, ASREN, and WACREN, highlights the 

instrumental role of National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) in supporting the 

SDGs. This paper specifically focuses on SDG 9, which emphasizes the establishment of 

resilient infrastructure, inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and innovation. 

In Uganda, the Research and Education Network for Uganda (RENU) is actively addressing 

SDG 9 by constructing the first marine optical fiber in Kalangala district, an island region in 

Lake Victoria. With 84 islands and a population of 67,000 individuals, Kalangala district faces 

economic challenges and resource isolation, leading to a high prevalence of HIV cases. RENU's 

efforts aim to extend reliable, high-speed Internet connectivity to underserved communities in 

Kalangala's island regions. 

This examination explores RENU's deployment of underwater fiber optic cables connecting 

the mainland (Bukakata area) to Bugala Island, benefiting educational and research institutions 

on the main island, including hospitals, schools, and tertiary institutions. The paper presents 

findings and recommendations, including promoting infrastructure sharing between national 

research and education networks and commercial Internet service providers. It also suggests 

the adoption of technically and financially sustainable connectivity technologies by member 

institutions and the implementation of complementary access solutions such as community 

networks, municipal networks, and cooperatives. 

By highlighting RENU's efforts and the outcomes of this examination, this paper provides 

valuable insights for leveraging NRENs to support global development initiatives, like SDG 9 

with initiatives such as RENU’s marine optical cable construction, and promote inclusive and 

sustainable development in underserved regions.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 

The efforts by RENU to establish optical fiber cable to the remote islands of Kalangala district 

have been made possible with a generous grant from the Internet Society Foundation through 

their Resiliency Program [13].  

This program supports projects that increase network resiliency in communities prone to 

natural disasters so that these communities will be better able to prepare for and withstand the 

effects of natural disasters on Internet connectivity. 

The Resiliency Program is one component of the Foundation’s RARE (Resiliency & 

Responding to Emergencies) Program, which seeks to help communities enhance preparedness 

and build Internet resiliency when faced with adverse events such as national disasters.

1. INTRODUCTION 

1.1. Background 

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 global goals 

adopted by all United Nations (UN) Member States in 2015 as part of the 2030 Agenda for 

Sustainable Development. These goals are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the 

planet, and ensure prosperity for all by 2030. They address various social, economic, and 

environmental challenges facing the world today and are interconnected, recognizing that 

progress in one area often depends on progress in others. 

SDG 9 is one of these 17 goals, and it focuses specifically on "Industry, Innovation, and 

Infrastructure with a specific goal of building resilient infrastructure, promoting inclusive and 

sustainable industrialization, and fostering innovation. 

Different organisations are tackling this through different efforts including RENU providing 

Internet connectivity to the remote island of Kalangala surrounded by Lake Victoria. Reliable 

connectivity will be established by the use of an underwater optical fibre cable and when 

established, will improve service delivery in schools, tertiary institutions and research 

organisations in the region by enabling research, learning and collaboration. 

1.2. Problem Statement 

Connectivity to institutions in Uganda’s underserved communities has been limited by 

inadequate investment from different for-profit (commercial) Internet service providers (ISPs), 

as such investments do not guarantee significant returns on investment. This is exacerbated by 

factors ranging from geographical location to terrain, and the demographics of the given area. 

Income levels also contribute to the investment drive of commercial companies. 

Such factors discourage many companies from expanding their network footprints and 

substituting their legacy provider equipment with cutting-edge technologies, as such cutovers 

are usually capital-intensive. 

With the ever-changing research-centred education curriculum in different institutions of 

learning and the need for fast collaboration among different research organizations in Uganda 

with their partners across the globe, the Internet is currently an essential and widely used tool. 

1.3. Objectives 

This paper explores RENU's efforts to contribute to global development agendas by 

establishing inclusive and cost-effective solutions to the community through deploying reliable 



UC  2023, October 26–27, 2023, Kampala - Uganda 

Internet connectivity using fiber cable to Kalangala islands and also presents findings and 

recommendations on how to promote connectivity in under-served communities. 

2. Literature Review 

2.1. Internet service connectivity landscape in Uganda. 

According to the Uganda Communications Commission (UCC) Market Report for the third 

quarter (3Q) financial year (FY) 2022-2023 between January to March 2023, Internet 

subscriptions experienced significant growth, adding *1.2 million new internet subscriptions 

and reaching a total of 27 million in the quarter ending March 2023. This was the second quarter 

in a row that saw growth, demonstrating a steadily rising Internet use trend.  

 

Figure 1: Internet Subscriptions Comparison 

* These numbers are based on the total number of subscriptions that use above 5MBs of data 

a month. 

The increased use of mobile phones and other data devices like tablets to access the internet is 

primarily responsible for the surge in subscriptions. The strong marketing campaigns for Fiber-

to-the-Home (FTTH) plans and Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets like car tracking devices by 

the telecom industry are accountable for their success [1]. 

Telecom companies like MTN Uganda, Airtel Uganda, and Africell provide mobile internet 

services. MTN Uganda and Airtel Uganda are the main companies dominating the Ugandan 

telecom market. With a 55% market share, MTN Uganda is the market leader with Airtel 

Uganda as the next biggest competitor [2]. 

Other companies like RENU run a private network that specializes in the provision of Internet 

connectivity and related services like cloud to research and education institutions in Uganda.

2.2. Challenges hindering Internet connectivity in Uganda. 

Limited Infrastructure in Rural Areas: The lack of adequate Internet connectivity in rural and 

distant places is one of the biggest obstacles. Rural areas lack or have sporadic connectivity 

due to the concentration of fiber optic cables and network infrastructure footprint in urban areas 

[3]. 

Affordability: Internet services are often considered expensive for many Ugandans, 

particularly those with low incomes. High data costs relative to average incomes make it 

challenging for some segments of the population to access the Internet regularly [3]. 

Geographical Challenges: Uganda is land-locked with no direct access to sea cables but to only 

overland cables [4] and its diverse geography, including lakes, rivers, and hilly and rugged 

terrain as shown in Figure 2, poses challenges for infrastructure deployment, including the 

extension of fiber optic cables. 

 

Figure 2: RENU Field Visit to Kalangala Cluster Office 

Quality of Service: Users in urban areas sometimes experience network congestion and slow 

internet speeds, especially during peak usage hours. This affects the quality of service, making 

it less reliable for tasks such as remote work and online learning. ISPs therefore have to pro-

actively monitor customer links and occasionally visit these sites to carry out tests and confirm 

optimal performance forexample during field checks as in Figure 3. 



UC  2023, October 26–27, 2023, Kampala - Uganda

Limited Digital Literacy: Many Ugandans lacked the digital literacy skills needed to make 

effective use of the Internet. This is particularly challenging for educational institutions and 

related initiatives that aim to leverage the Internet for learning [3]. 

2.3. Existing Initiatives to expand Internet connectivity in Uganda. 

Expanding internet connectivity in Uganda has been a priority for the government and various 

organizations. Several initiatives have been launched to address the challenges and bring the 

benefits of the Internet to more Ugandans. 

Initiatives by non-governmental organisations include the Kalangala Connect Project where 

RENU, with funding from the Internet Society (ISOC) Foundation, is building an optical fiber 

cable to extend reliable and high-speed Internet to the islands of Kalangala. 

Other efforts by governmental organisations include the National Information Infrastructure 

(NII) Project where the government of Uganda is extending fiber optic connectivity to 

underserved areas, including rural regions [6]. This project aimed to improve internet access 

and digital services in remote areas.  

Another project by the government of Uganda managed by the Uganda Communications 

Commission (UCC) is the Uganda Communications Universal Services Access Fund 

(UCUSAF) where UCC partnered with RENU and Airtel to provide dedicated Internet 

connectivity links with a capacity of 5Mbps to over 90 schools [5].

3. Findings, Projected Benefits and Recommendations 

3.1. Findings leading up to Kalangala Connect Project 

Kalangala district has a total population of over 67,200 people (according to the 2020 

projection by the Uganda Bureau of Statistics) with only 15 health facilities and 56 schools.  

The area is affected by natural disasters like floods and cyclones [8] which in turn lead to a 

widespread of diseases like Cholera, typhoid etc. which puts a strain on the inadequate and ill-

equipped health facilities on the island. The problem of such inadequate facilities is made worse 

by the island’s undeveloped transport system as elaborated in the 2020 US Mission report to 

the Ugandan people [7].  

RENU believed that the Internet could help bridge the gap. Thus at the start of 2022, RENU 

intervened and connected forteen (14) health facilities in Kalangala Islands (Bwendero HC III, 

Kalangala Cluster, Kalangala DHO, Kalangala HC IV, Bufumira HC III, Mulabana HC II, 

Kachanga Island HC II, Kasekulo HC II, Bubeke HC III, Lujabbwa Island HC II, Lulambwa 

HC III, Bukasa HC IV, Jaana HC II and SIAAP) on the wireless connection [9], but that is very 

unstable. 

 

Figure 4: Sector Out Door Unit (ODU) Installed serving Bufumira HC III 

The unstable Internet connection is also a general problem on the island because Uganda’s 

commercial Internet Service Providers (ISPs) shun it due to the sparse population. It thus does 

not make business sense for ISPs to establish a resilient network presence in the district. The 

Island district's geographical location is also to blame for the poor connectivity [12]. 



UC  2023, October 26–27, 2023, Kampala - Uganda 

 

Figure 5: RENU field team members walking to an island site in Kalangala 

Such problems affect essential service delivery, particularly in the education and health sectors 

especially where long distances need to be made to access such vital centers as in Figure 5. 

3.2. Projected benefits from the Kalangala Connect Project 

The project will be implemented in Bugala Island found in Kalangala District in the Central 

region of Uganda.

Easier access to Information and Education materials: Reliable Internet access will enable 

residents of Kalangala to access a wealth of information, educational resources, and online 

courses. This will lead to improved educational outcomes, including higher literacy rates and 

increased knowledge across various subjects. 

Enhanced Healthcare Services: Healthcare facilities on the islands will benefit from 

telemedicine services, allowing for remote consultations, diagnosis, and monitoring of patients. 

RENU is already connecting over 9 facilities under the Center for Disease Control (CDC)/ 

Rakai Health Sciences Program (RHSP) project using Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and 

microwave access methods. 

Economic Opportunities: Access to the reliable Internet will open up new economic 

opportunities in different fields including agriculture, tourism, and online government services 

that aid commerce. Residents will be able to easily explore online entrepreneurship, access e-

commerce platforms to sell products and connect with markets beyond the islands.  

Disaster Preparedness and Response: Access to the Internet will improve disaster preparedness 

and response mechanisms. Communities will be able to swiftly receive early warnings and 

access resources and information during emergencies. 

This intervention to improve Internet connectivity will improve the area's education, health and 

economic standards, thus hastening the island's social and economic development. 

3.3. Recommendations 

Reducing Internet costs and expanding access, especially to underserved areas is crucial for 

bridging the digital divide and fostering economic and social development. Here are 

recommendations to achieve these goals: 

Infrastructure Sharing: UCC is leading regulatory efforts in promoting infrastructure sharing 

especially through revising the national telecom licensing framework [10] to incorporate such 

new dynamics. The commission has also published different guidelines on infrastructure 

deployment and sharing with an aim to encourage Internet service providers (ISPs), including 

national research and education networks (NRENs), other (commercial) Internet service 

providers, and telecom companies to share infrastructure such as fiber optic cables, cell towers, 

and data centres [11]. This reduces capital expenditure and operational costs, which can be 

passed on to consumers through lower prices. 



UC  2023, October 26–27, 2023, Kampala - Uganda 

Adoption of technically and financially sustainable connectivity technologies by member 

institutions: Internet service providers especially national research and education networks are 

recommended to adopt the use of cost-effective and technically-capable technologies, 

especially for last-mile connectivity. Innovative solutions like fixed wireless access for 

example 4G LTE and 5G, satellite, and mesh networks can be cost-effective, especially for 

reaching remote areas [12].  

Use of complementary access solutions such as community networks, municipal networks, and 

cooperatives: Combining backhaul technologies (like Plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) 

and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH)/Synchronous optical networking and Point-to-

multipoint microwave-access technologies) with access solutions such as community setup and 

managed networks, for example, a Community LTE (CoLTE) eases the building of financially 

sustainable networks mostly in underserved areas [12]. Where there is no practical way to 

provide continuous coverage or multiple cells, community networks are the right answer for 

distant settlements and islands where customers can still benefit from mobile broadband 

connectivity. 

Discussion, Future Work and Conclusion. 

The Kalangala Connect project, currently at the inception stage, will be done in phases with 

the end goal of establishing a dedicated marine optical fiber cable from Bukakata mainland to 

Bugala island in the Kalangala district. Robust access technologies, for example, Fiber to any 

given site (commonly referred to as FTTx) including fiber to the home (FTTH) will drastically 

reduce Internet costs and aid the expansion of fiber footprint especially when users are involved 

in deployments [14]. This will greatly reduce dependence on unreliable wireless technologies 

such as microwave technology in the future. 

The success of the NREN's member institutions' collective digital future hinges on how well 

and how quickly we deliver the affordable, accessible, resilient, and reliant digital connectivity 

required for the establishment and operation of an inclusive digital society with the aim of 

fostering collaboration in research and education.
