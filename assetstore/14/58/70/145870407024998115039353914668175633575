Introduction

● Bandwidth Efficiency: Utilising subscribed bandwidth in a non-

wasteful way.

● What would waste bandwidth? It depends:

○ Personal / Organisational goals: Social media platforms

○ Entertainment: Advertisements

○ Careless network administration: (volumetric) Denial of Service attacks

○ ...e.t.c...

Enabling Research & Education Collaboration

Solution Effectiveness: Other challenges

• Scalability
• From a home to an NREN

• Insufficient blocklists (Whack-A-Mole)
• Against today’s dynamic applications

• Against today’s threats

• Circumvention technology
• VPNs, DNS-over-QUIC, etc...

Enabling Research & Education Collaboration

Conclusion and Future Work

• App Filtering with DNS sinkholing 

solves some things (cybersecurity), 

but not everything (bandwidth 

consumption optimisation)

• Institutions need more capacity!

• More sophisticated solutions (AI??)
• Privacy issues??

• Scalability & robustness
