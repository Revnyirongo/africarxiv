Navigating connectivity in underserved areas of rural Africa poses several challenges, particularly in regions where proper road 
infrastructure is lacking or poorly maintained. These challenges can significantly impact the deployment and maintenance of 
digital infrastructure. Some specific challenges include:

• Inadequate Road Infrastructure: Eastern, Central, and Southern Africa often face issues with poor road infrastructure 
in rural areas, making it difficult to access underserved communities. The lack of proper roads hinders the transportation of 
materials and equipment required for deploying and maintaining digital infrastructure.

• Maintenance Issues: The challenges with maintaining road infrastructure in these areas can further affect the 
maintenance of digital infrastructure. Damaged or poorly maintained roads make it challenging to carry out regular 
maintenance activities on the digital infrastructure network.

• Rehabilitation and Relocation: Rehabilitation or relocation of road infrastructure, water and sewerage utilities, and 
property development projects can inadvertently lead to damage to the digital infrastructure. These activities may involve 
excavation or construction work that can disrupt or cause harm to the existing digital infrastructure.

• Bushfires: Rural areas in Africa are susceptible to bushfires, which can pose a significant threat to overhead infrastructure 
such as fiber optic cables. The risk of damage from bushfires necessitates strategic planning and protective measures to 
ensure the resilience of the digital infrastructure.

• Lack of Awareness: Communities in underserved areas may lack awareness of the importance of digital infrastructure. 
Without proper education and understanding, there is a risk of intentional damage or vandalism to the deployed 
infrastructure.

Overcoming Connectivity Challenges: Connecting Underserved Areas in Africa



To navigate connectivity in rural Africa, innovative approaches utilizing railroads and submarine deployments have shown 
promising results:

Railroad Connectivity: Railroads still play a crucial role in cargo and human transportation across 
East, Central, and Southern Africa. Leveraging the existing railroad infrastructure can provide an 
efficient pathway for deploying digital infrastructure.

Deployment along the Railroad Corridors: BCS Group has developed deployment methods 
along railroad corridors. These methods include both overhead and underground deployment 
approaches. Overhead infrastructure involves installing fiber optic cables on existing railway 
structures, such as poles or bridges. Underground deployment utilizes mechanized techniques like 
the Rail Ripper and Plough to bury fiber optic cables alongside the rail tracks.

Submarine Connectivity: The region's numerous lakes 
and rivers offer potential routes for deploying digital 
infrastructure. These bodies of water are still used for 
transportation, and leveraging them for submarine 
deployments can bring connectivity to underserved areas.

Deployment along Lakes and Rivers: BCS Group has 
developed methodologies for deploying digital 
infrastructure along lakes and rivers in Sub Sahara Africa. 
By utilizing specialized equipment and techniques, such as 
submarine cable laying vessels, the group can effectively 
lay submarine cables beneath the water bodies.

Last Mile Connectivity in Schools: Open Access Model Solutions

The Open Access model in bridging the digital divide for underserved schools is a powerful solution that addresses various 
challenges hindering access to digital education. 

The Open Access model in FTTx (Fiber to the X) refers to an approach where the physical fiber infrastructure is shared among 
multiple service providers, allowing them to offer their services over the same network. 

In the Open Access model, the fiber network infrastructure is owned and maintained by a neutral entity, often referred to as a 
wholesale network operator or infrastructure provider. This entity is responsible for deploying and managing the physical fiber 
network, including the fiber cables, distribution points, and other necessary equipment.

Multiple service providers, such as internet service providers (ISPs), telecom operators, or content providers, can lease or 
access the fiber infrastructure from the wholesale network operator. These service providers can then offer their own 
broadband, voice, video, or other value-added services to end-users (residential or commercial) over the shared network.

The key characteristics of the Open Access model in FTTx include:

1. Infrastructure Sharing: The physical fiber infrastructure is shared among multiple service providers, avoiding the need 
for each provider to build and maintain its separate network.

2. Non-Discriminatory Access: The wholesale network operator treats all service providers equally, providing them with 
fair and non-discriminatory access to the infrastructure. 

3. Service Provider Competition: End-users have the freedom to choose their preferred service provider from the 
available options, promoting competition among service providers based on pricing, service quality, and value-added 
offerings.

4. Network Neutrality: The Open Access model supports network neutrality principles, which means that the network 
operator treats all data transmitted over the network equally, without favoring or discriminating against specific services, 
applications, or content.

5. Simplified Operations: The wholesale network operator takes care of the physical network operations and 
maintenance, including troubleshooting, repairs, and capacity upgrades. Service providers can focus on delivering their 
services without the burden of managing the underlying infrastructure.



The Open Access model offers innovative approaches to tackle issues such as;

Cybersecurity In Connectivity

Items Action point Description

Regulatory 
Compliance

Ensure compliance with relevant cybersecurity regulations and standards, meeting 
specific security requirements set by regulatory authorities.

Follow the Rules: There are some rules set by the people in charge to keep the internet 
safe. We make sure to follow those rules to keep everyone protected.

Physical Security Restrict physical access to fiber optic cables and related infrastructure to prevent 
tampering or damage. Surveillance systems can enhance physical security.

Lock the Doors: We have to make sure that the places where the internet cables and 
equipment are kept are locked up tight, like locking the doors to your house.

Network Security Deploy firewalls and intrusion detection systems to monitor and control network 
traffic, safeguarding against cyber threats and unauthorized access.

Guard the Highway: Think of the internet highway as a road. We need security guards 
(firewalls and detectors) to watch over it and make sure no bad guys enter or do 

anything harmful.

Encryption 
Protocols

Implement robust encryption protocols to secure data transmitted over fiber optic 
cables, preventing unauthorized access or interception.

Keep Information Secret: Imagine the internet is like a highway, and your data is the 
cars driving on it. To keep your data safe, we use special codes to lock it up so that only 

the right people can see it.

Endpoint Security Ensure that devices connected to the fiber network have updated antivirus and anti-
malware software, reducing the risk of malicious software compromising the 

security of the network.

Protect Your Devices: Just like you have antivirus on your computer to keep it safe, we 
need to make sure all the devices connected to the internet are protected too.

Data Backups Regularly back up critical data to facilitate quick recovery in case of a cyber incident, 
minimizing the impact of potential data loss.

Backup Important Stuff: Like how you make copies of your favorite photos, we also 
need to make copies of important internet data, so if something goes wrong, we can 

get it back.

Regular Software 
Updates

Keep all hardware and software components, including routers and switches, up to 
date with the latest security patches to mitigate vulnerabilities.

Keep Things Up to Date: You know how your phone needs updates? Well, all the 
internet equipment needs updates too, so they stay strong against cyber-attacks.

Incident Response 
and Disaster 

Recovery Plans

Develop and implement robust incident response plans to address cybersecurity 
incidents promptly. Having disaster recovery plans ensures the rapid restoration of 

services.

Have a Plan for Emergencies: When bad things happen, like a cyber-attack, we need a 
plan to fix things fast, just like how firefighters have a plan for putting out fires.

User Education Conduct training programs to educate users and stakeholders about cybersecurity 
best practices, emphasizing the importance of recognizing and reporting potential 

security threats

Learn How to Stay Safe: We teach people how to recognize and avoid cyber threats, 
like not opening emails from strangers or sharing important passwords.

Collaboration and 
Information 

Sharing

Foster collaboration among stakeholders to share information about emerging 
threats and vulnerabilities, strengthening the collective defense against cyber 

threats.

Work Together: We all work together like a team. If someone sees a problem, they tell 
others so that we can all stay safe on the internet highway.

• Cybersecurity refers to the set of practices, technologies, and measures implemented to safeguard digital networks, systems, and data from cyber
