What we'll cover

● What are persistent identifiers and what do they do? 

● What is ROR and what does it offer?

● Examples of ROR integrations, especially in Africa

● The future of research with ROR



What are 
persistent 

identifiers and 
what do they 

do?



ror.org

Persistent identifiers (PIDs) - definition

A PID (persistent identifier) is a digital identifier that is globally 
unique, persistent, machine resolvable, has an associated metadata 
schema, identifies an entity (e.g. a person/researcher, publication, 
award, organization, or research output), and is frequently used to 
disambiguate between entities. … The identifier is a string of 
numbers, letters, and/or symbols assigned to the digital object.

What is ROR 
and what does 

it offer?



ror.org

The Research Organization 
Registry (ROR) is a global, 

community-led registry of open 
persistent identifiers for 
research organizations.

What problems does ROR solve? 

● Many different variants of organization names in user-entered, free 
text data make internal reporting difficult and produce inconsistent 
search results

● Research institutions have a hard time tracking the output of their 
researchers

● Funders have a hard time tracking research outputs they have 
funded

User submits 
research in a 

system integrated 
with ROR

Organization is 
selected from a 
ROR-powered 
controlled list

Shareable 
metadata 

includes the 
ROR ID

Systems use 
the ROR ID to 
track research 
by organization

ROR is designed for research workflows



ror.org

ROR enables data to travel between systems 
with no barriers and no distortion



ror.org

ROR makes information about research 
organizations clean, normalized, and easy to 

exchange among software systems so that journal 
articles, datasets, and other research outputs can 
be reliably associated with universities, funders, 
companies, laboratories, and other institutions.

ROR is well-established and community-led
● ROR was developed over three years of workshops and working groups from 

2016-2018 in which 17 organizations outlined requirements for an open 
organization identifier.

● In 2018, a Steering Group consisting of California Digital Library, Crossref, 
DataCite, and Digital Science stepped up to implement the ROR pilot with a 
donation of seed data from Digital Science’s GRID database. 

● In 2019, a "minimum viable registry" was launched as a sync of GRID. 
● In July 2021, GRID announced its plans to sunset its public data and pass 

the torch to ROR. 
● In March 2022, ROR released its first independently curated registry. GRID 

URLs ceased to resolve in June 2022.
