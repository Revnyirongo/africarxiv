The challenge in managing research performance 
(institutional/individual) is access to accurate useable 
researcher activities data

Such (accurate) data allows:
➢Managing/leveraging partnerships
➢Better individual/institutional level reporting and 

impact assessment/evaluation
➢Monitoring/track progress 
➢Measuring impact of research
➢Charting strategic research directions

Background

    2  http://www.uonbi.ac.ke



➢How is information on researcher activities collected 
and is it well collated? 

➢Research Grants Management Information Systems

➢E-repository

➢Performance appraisal systems 

➢Staff web profiles 

➢On subscriptions: ORCID, Scopus/SciVal, Web of 
science/Clarivate, PURE, Converis, InfoEd, etc

➢Others: Google scholar, LinkedIn, Research Gate

➢Self reporting for promotion or request for 
institutional support

➢At best, information on researcher activities is 
fragmented and mostly incomplete

Current sources of 
researcher activities data

      http://www.uonbi.ac.ke



➢No reporting capabilities

➢Not searchable

➢Lacking in accuracy and completeness

➢No. of researchers on the platforms unclear

➢Good platforms/systems are expensive and almost 
exclusive, skews performance tracking (e.g. web of 
science)

Challenges with current 
sources

University of Nairobi                                 4  http://www.uonbi.ac.ke



➢ Compromised accuracy of the information at individual 
and institutional level

➢ Compromised ability to evaluate research impact

➢ Compromised ability to communicate research 
outcomes to end users/policy makers

➢ Lack of a system that allows accurate 
reporting/monitoring/recognitions

The results of incomplete 
information

    5  http://www.uonbi.ac.ke



What it will allow

➢ Collection and collation of researcher activity 
information effectively and efficiently

➢Accurate research reporting at individual/institutional 
level

➢ Enable accurate performance evaluation/monitoring

➢Managing/Leveraging/track partnerships and 
collaborations

➢ Better strategic research directions and planning

➢ Backs affirmations for the institution on 
strengths/weaknesses

The need for Researcher 
Profile Application 

    6  http://www.uonbi.ac.ke



➢ Incompleteness and inaccuracy of research activities 
data

➢ Inconsistencies in research activities/outcomes 
reporting

➢Weak data governance structure/access structures

HOW?

➢Self populating by the researchers

➢Hooking the information system to annual staff 
performance appraisal systems

What Researcher Profile 
information system 

would address

The structure

Staff Academic 

Performance System 

(SAPS) - collates courses 

taught, student 

supervision, publications, 

IP, comm. engagement, 

professional services,

Collaborations, etc

Scope and Access 
structure of RPA

    9  http://www.uonbi.ac.ke



➢ System is self populated for accuracy

➢ System is open most of the year for self updating by 
staff (Real time updates)

➢ Hooked to other information systems/repositories 
with ability to fetch data from other repositories

➢ Robust reporting capabilities 

Advantages of RPA

    10  http://www.uonbi.ac.ke



1. Sustainability

➢ Cost of implementation/management

➢Usability

➢ Value

➢ Structure

2. Ownership 

➢ (buy-in, compliance, Structures)

4. Existing structure 

➢ (Infrastructure, management framework, capacity, 
capabilities)

Considerations for the 
Change

    11  http://www.uonbi.ac.ke



➢Allow for flexibility  - (implementation and in 
planning, timelines). 

➢Allow room to adapt plans

➢Buy-in is multi level and multi directional

➢Every one at every level must be able to see the 
value

➢Planning for institutional change can be very 
dynamic - find what else the change can 
complement

➢Change should never be a burden

Lessons learnt so far

   12   http://www.uonbi.ac.ke



Deliverables;

➢Buy-in through engagement at various levels –
Completed and continuous

➢Baseline survey and report - completed

➢Developer proposal  - done

Pending issues;

➢Developing the information system 

➢User training

➢Roll- out
