Why RARE?

One platform that provides multiple solutions. Each solution is able to address a 
specific Research and Education use case or need.

NREN Survey

● A survey was carried out to gain 
insights into NREN backbones.
o Most of the NRENs operate 

multivendor backbones
○ A few NRENs lack their own network 

equipment and instead rely on 
infrastructure of local operators 

○ Twelve out of thirteen NRENs 
operate dual stack backbones, 
supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 

○ Three out of thirteen NRENs offer 
MPLS services including L2VPNs 
and L2VPNs.  

○ Two NRENs run PIM

Use Cases

Validation Lab

● Juniper, Cisco IOS-XE and 
RARE/Freertr

● Routing Protocols
○ Intermediate System to Intermediate 

System (IS-IS)
○ Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) 

● BGP Scaling Techniques
o Peer groups (Templates), Route 

Reflectors

● Multiprotocol Label Switching 
(MPLS) Applications
o VPNs and  RSVP-TE

Value Proposition 

● As an open source software, RARE does not require any license
● For NRENs that are yet to deploy their own network equipment, you can

○ recycle old servers to act as 1Gbps CPEs for primary and secondary schools, OOB servers, 
route reflectors etc or

○ procure commodity hardware at lower price points to serve as
■ 10Gbps CPEs for end-user institutions such as university campuses, research centres
■ Nx10,25,40,100Gbps Internet transit gateways or core nodes
■ Nx10,25,40,100Gbps Data Centre spine or edge
■ Nx10,25,40,100Gbps IXP or PNI peering node
